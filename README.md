### 👋 Heyo!!! 👋
My name is Victor Li. Thanks for checking out my Github. Currently, I'm a 3rd year CS student in the AI stream at Carleton University.

Currently, I'm working with the Carleton Computer Science Society Dev team, where we create resources for CS students in Carleton to help them through their academics. I'm working on the resources: the CCSS website and the auto grader for the COMP 2404 class. 

On top of this, I'm currently learning 🦀 Rust.
