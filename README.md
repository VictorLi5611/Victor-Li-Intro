### 👋 Heyo!!! 👋
My name is Victor Li. Thanks for checking out my Github. Currently, I'm a 3rd year CS student in the AI stream at Carleton University.

### 💻 What I'm Focusing on 💻
Currently, I'm working with the Carleton Computer Science Society Dev team, where we create resources for CS students in Carleton to help them through their academics. I'm working on the resources: the CCSS website and the auto grader for the COMP 2404 class. 

On top of this, I'm currently learning 🦀 Rust.
